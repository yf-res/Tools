Explanation
Load the Images: 
The images are loaded in grayscale mode.
Calculate Optical Flow: 
We use the calcOpticalFlowFarneback method to calculate the dense optical flow between the two images.
Warp the Images: 
Using the computed optical flow, we warp the first image to create the interpolated images at the specified factors (0.25 and 0.75).
Display and Save: 
Finally, we display the original and interpolated images and save the interpolated images to files.
Make sure you have OpenCV and matplotlib installed in your environment. You can install them using pip if necessary:

sh
pip install opencv-python-headless matplotlib

Replace 'image1.png' and 'image2.png' with the paths to your actual images. This script will generate and save the interpolated images as interpolated_0_25.png and interpolated_0_75.png.
